Project Title
ComicCity: A Web Application for Comic Enthusiasts

Project Idea
ComicCity is a user-friendly web application designed for comic lovers to upload, read, and explore comics of their choice. 
The platform aims to create a seamless experience for users to manage their comic collections and discover new content. 
It features four main sections: Home, Upload, Comics, and About Us, and integrates third-party authentication via Auth0 to ensure secure and easy access.

Brief Description
Home: Welcomes users with an overview of the app and highlights popular or recently uploaded comics.
Upload: Allows users to upload their own comic files (e.g., images) to share.
Comics: Displays a library of uploaded comics, with options to read.
About Us: Provides information about the project and its creators.
Authentication: Leverages Auth0 for secure login and user management.
This capstone project focuses on building a functional, responsive, and secure web app using modern web development technologies.
